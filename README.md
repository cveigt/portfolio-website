# Hi there,

Welcome to my [personal website](http://veigt.com/).

## Installation

At the moment, you can only fork and clone this project. Will make a better way to run it locally int he future.

- `git clone https://github.com/cveigt/veigt.com`
- You're all set!

## This website
I created this repository for me. However, storing my code in GitHub is convenient and practical. I open-sourced this project so you can use as a template for yours or adapt to your needs.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
