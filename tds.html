					PASTE DESIGN SYSTEM
				</h2>
				<div class="line"></div>
				<span>Design Systems</span>
				<p>
					In late 2017, I moved from being embeeded into a product team, to become part of the Twilio Console design team. At the time, Twilio had a design system, however it wasn't a scalable one.
				</br>
				</br>
When I joined the team, the system had some issues:
<br>
<br>
- There wasn't anyone owning and leading the system.
<br>
- There were many dependencies from other teams.
<br>
- Unmaintenance and inconsistency in both, design and react libraries.
<br>
- Lack of vision.
</br>
</br>
<strong>My role:</strong>
Due to the resources constrains, I split my time between my asigned products and design systems. I started working along with one of the best designer I've ever known who lead the project while I did more design work.

From audit and components inventory to build and spec patterns and components, from setting naming conventions, to fix and define perceptual patterns in systematical ways, my role was more on the design side than the actual front-end side where the foundations of the new systems were built.

					For someone like me with no previous experience building a design system, it was probably my best explorative experience so far. I also worked with a very talented team of seven people remotely distributed. 2 people in San Francisco, 4 more in Ukraine, and 1 more in NY.
					<br>
					<br>
While the engineers were establishing the new architecture and fixing outdated components, I spent my time speccing components, defining usage, behavior, etc.. as well as defining the system structure of the design library.

				<strong>Result:</strong>
We went from manually storing and versioning a style guide in Google Drive and a Google Sheet to having a properly structured set of Sketch libraries, living in Abstract and collectively maintained.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, an updated and refactored react library with clearer documentation and onboarding guides for developers on how to use, how to contribute back, and how to request fixes, improvement, or brand new components.
<br>
<br>
<strong>The future:</strong>
Once we finished it and met our initial goal, I started gathering feedback from both sides, product design, and front-end teams. Later on, I got pulled into other products full-time again but I keep contributing as much as I can.
