					PASTE DESIGN SYSTEM
				</h2>
				<div class="line"></div>
				<span>Design Systems</span>
				<p>
					In late 2017, I moved from being embedded into a product team, to become part of the Twilio Console design team. At the time, Twilio had a design system. However, it wasn't scalable enough.
				</br>
				</br>
				When I joined the team, the main issues were:
<br>
<br>
- There was no ownership.
<br>
- There were many dependencies from other teams, making it hard to maintain and ship efficiently.
<br>
- Unmaintenance and inconsistency in both, design and react libraries.
<br>
- Lack of vision. Without a clear vision and ownership, the system wasn't serving any purpose and became unreliable for product teams.
</br>
</br>
<strong>My role:</strong>
<br>
Due to the resources constraints, I split my time between products I had assigned and design systems. I started working along with one of the best designers I've ever worked with, who lead the team at the time. We started working side by side on design and development. From audit and components inventory to build and spec patterns and components, from setting naming conventions, to fix and define perceptual patterns in systematic ways, my role was more on the design side than the actual front-end side where the foundations of the new systems were built.

				<p>
					I was part of a distributed. 2 people in San Francisco, 4 more in Ukraine, and 1 more in NY.
					<br>
					<br>
					While the engineers with some help from a front-end architect established the new architecture and fixed outdated components, I spent my time speccing components, defining usage, behavior, etc.. as well as defining the system structure of the design library and the systems' principles.
				</p>

				<strong>Result:</strong>
				From manually storing and versioning a style guide in Google Drive and Google Sheet to have a properly and structured set of Sketch libraries, living in Abstract and collectively maintained.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, an updated and refactored react library with clearer documentation and onboarding guides for developers on how to use, how to contribute back, and how to request fixes, improvements, or brand new components.
<br>
<br>
<strong>The future:</strong>
Once the initial goal was met, I started gathering feedback from both sides, product design, and front-end teams so I could start identifying what works and what doesn't for designers and developers, as well as identifying bottlenecks when implementing components.
<br>
<br>
Also, future may include adoption and version monitoring, automation.
