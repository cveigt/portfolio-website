				<span>Two-Factor Authentication Product</span>
				<p>
					Authy is the leader 2FA app in the market, with millions of users and accounts protected. Its most powerful features are encrypted backups, multi-device support, and easy-to-use.
				</br>
				</br>
				Through the years, the app has gone from being a simple single code generator to support multiple authentication protocols, expanding its capabilities and becoming one of the most reliables 2FA solutions to end-users and enterprise. Nowadays, Authy is available for iOS, Android, Desktop and support most of their devices.
<br>
<br>
<strong>The Challenge:</strong>
<br>
In principle, all Authy needed to do was to display a 7-digit authentication code every 20 seconds. The real challenge was that if you know what 2FA is, you also know that while it can make your accounts safer, it can also lock you out if you lose the second factor, being this your phone or computer in this case.
<br>
<br>
One of the first things I decided to work on was on building a simple but practical style guide and kind of a basic design system to set some rules and principles up.
</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Onboarding:</strong>
					<br>
					As a 2-Factor Authentication product, you have to take into account that people's accounts can be hacked, especially when they enable 2FA to secure such services as crypto wallets, and financial or banking accounts. That means that the registration process needs to be clear and collect what is needed to keep the account as safe as possible in the future.
					<br>
					<br>
					Additionally, I designed a walkthrough explaining the concept of 2FA and how Authy works. That changed later when we got some data and insights from the type of users that were using the app and how they were using it.
					<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Tokens:</strong>
					The main player in our app has always been the token or auth code view. Here's where you see what you need, the second factor. While all the apps were just showing an account name and a flat code by that time, we wanted to go beyond, so we built a clean and beautiful screen with 4 elements:
					<br>
					<br>
					1. Service and account name.
					<br>
					2. The authentication code.
					<br>
					3. An animated timer.
					<br>
					4. Service logo.

				<p>
				<strong>Result:</strong>
				People loved the fact that each account is different and easy to identify because of the logo. Later, I made it even more engaging by making the background and font colours a part of the brand.
<br>
<br>
Also, after noticing that people enter the code wrong sometimes,  I worked on an improved authentication code by breaking the code down in chunks to enhance readability. Another significant change was the expiration time; I extended it to 30 seconds. By the time, as much analytics as wanted couldn't be afforded, which means that only the most important events were tracked. In addition to that, digging into app store reviews, Twitter comments, and support emails helped me to get more insights and qualitative data to identify user needs.
<br>
<br>
And finally, after finding the need for a desktop app, the two features that boosted user growth were added. Until these days, backups and multi-device are the most loved features and biggest differentiators over other competitors.
