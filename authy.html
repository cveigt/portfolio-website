				<span>Two-Factor Authentication Product</span>
				<p>
					Authy is the leader 2FA app in the market with millions of users and accounts protected.
				</br>
				</br>
				Through the years, the app has gone from being a simple single code generator to support multiple authentication protocols, offering features such as most powerful features are encrypted backups, multi-device support and easy-to-use, becoming one of the most reliables 2FA solutions to the end-user and enterprise.  Nowadays, Authy is available for iOS, Android, Desktop across multiple devices.
<br>
<br>
<strong>The Challenge:</strong>
<br>
In principle, all Authy needs to have is the ability to display a 7-digit authentication code every 20 seconds. The real challenge was that if you know what 2FA is, you also know that while it can make your accounts safer, it can also lock you out if you lose the second factor, your phone or computer in this case.
<br>
<br>
One of the first tasks I decided to work on was on building a simple but practical style guide and kind of a basic design system to set some rules and principles from the ground.				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Onboarding:</strong>
					<br>
					As a 2-Factor Authentication product, you have to take into account that people's accounts can be hacked, especially when they enable 2FA to secure such services as crypto wallets or banking accounts. That means that the registration process needs to be clear and collect what we need to keep the account as safe as possible in the future. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Additionally, I designed a walkthrough explaining the concept of 2FA and how Authy works. That changed later when we got some data and insights from the type of users that were using the app and how they were using it.
					<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Tokens:</strong>
					The main player in our app has been always de authentication token or code screen. Here's where you see what you need, the second factor. While all the apps were just showing an account name and a flat code by that time, we wanted to go beyond, so we built a clean and beautiful screen with 4 elements:
					<br>
					<br>
					1. Service and account name.
					<br>
					2. The authentication code.
					<br>
					3. An animated timer.
					<br>
					4. Service logo.

				<p>
				<strong>Result:</strong>
				People loved the fact that each account is different and easy to identify because of the logo. Later, we made it even more engaging by making the background and font colors a part of the brand.
<br>
<br>
We also improved the authentication code when we noticed that people enter the code wrong sometimes, so I tried breaking the code down in chunks to improve readability. Another important improvement was the expiration time, I extended it to 30 seconds. By the time we couldn't afford as much analytics as we wanted, meaning that we only tracked the most important events, additional to that, I used to dig into app store reviews, Twitter comments, and support emails to get insights and identify user needs.
<br>
<br>
And finally, after finding the need for a desktop app, we added the two features that boosted our user growth. Until these days, backups and multi-device are our most loved features and biggest differentiators over other competitors.
